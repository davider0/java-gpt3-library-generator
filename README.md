# Java Library Generator powered by OpenAI's GPT3.5
basically a robot that tells you what library and method you need to do certain tasks in java bcuz uni teachers keep demanding to do things that didn't show in class nor documentation

âœ…for example, if your input is "sort an array"
the bot will tell "java.util.Arrays, Arrays.sort()"
